## Credits

Cinnamon theme crafted by smurphos. Build tools are at [Cinnamox_theme_master](https://github.com/smurphos/cinnamox_theme_master).

GTK2, GTK3 and Metacity1 themes built with [Cinnamox-gtk-theme](https://github.com/smurphos/cinnamox-gtk-theme) a fork of [Oomox-gtk-theme](https://github.com/actionless/oomox-gtk-theme).

Menu in screenshots is the excellent [CinnVIIStarkMenu](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/281).

Icons in screenshots are from [Vibrancy Colours](http://www.ravefinity.com/p/vibrancy-colors-gtk-icon-theme.html).

## Installation

Install via Cinnamon's Themes module in Cinnamon settings or download from [Cinnamon Spices](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes) and unzip into your `~/.themes` directory.

The themes are also available via [openDesktop.org](https://www.opendesktop.org/member/491875/) or [my Github repository](https://github.com/smurphos/cinnamox_themes/releases).

Select the Cinnamox theme as your Desktop, Controls and Window Borders in the Cinnamon Themes module.

To allow the GTK2, GTK3 and Metacity1 themes to apply to GUI apps running as root run this command in your terminal after installation to create symlinks to user themes in the system theme directory.

`sudo ln -s ~/.themes/* /usr/share/themes/`

## Tweaking

### Cinnamon Theme Transparency

The theme includes an interactive bash script that allows end users to adjust the transparency of the Cinnamon Theme. The default is no transparency.

To access the tool open a terminal window (Ctrl-Alt-T) and use the following command to make the script executable and launch it. 

`chmod +x ~/.themes/#THEMENAME/cinnamon/cinnamox_transparency.sh && ~/.themes/#THEMENAME/cinnamon/cinnamox_transparency.sh`

If you are not happy with the end result simply run `~/.themes/#THEMENAME/cinnamon/cinnamox_transparency.sh` again to chose another option including the default.

### GTK2 HIDPI support

If you need HIDPI Support in GTK2 the theme includes a HIDPI version of the gtkrc theme file and a helper script to toggle between the regular and HIDPI version.

To run the script open a terminal window (Ctrl-Alt-T) and use the following command to make the script executable and launch it. 

`chmod +x ~/.themes/#THEMENAME/gtk-2.0/cinnamox_toggle_GTK2_HIDPI.sh && ~/.themes/#THEMENAME/gtk-2.0/cinnamox_toggle_GTK2_HIDPI.sh`

After the first run you can toggle between the two using `~/.themes/#THEMENAME/gtk-2.0/cinnamox_toggle_GTK2_HIDPI.sh`

### qt5ct support

If you need support for qt5ct configuration the theme includes a premade qt5ct.conf file and a helper script to install it to the correct location `~/.config/qt5ct/colors`

To run the script open a terminal window (Ctrl-Alt-T) and use the following command to make the script executable and launch it. 

`chmod +x ~/.themes/#THEMENAME/qt5ct/cinnamox_enable_qt5ct.sh && ~/.themes/#THEMENAME/qt5ct/cinnamox_enable_qt5ct.sh`
